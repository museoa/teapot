The new build system uses CMake (http://www.cmake.org). It handles
all platform differences.

See the README for required third-party libraries.

The documentation can only be built if you have latex2html (version
2008), pdflatex and lyx installed. If you don't, turn off the
ENABLE_HELP option (using the ccmake command or any other CMake
frontend).

Note that the GUI version definitely needs FLTK-1.3, so you may need
to download and build an SVN snapshot. SVN r7704 was used for development.
You MUST use CMake to configure FLTK, not "./configure". You don't need
to install it, as FLTK is so small that statically linking it (the default)
is safe. If you don't install FLTK, set the path to your FLTK directory
 using ccmake.

For the console version you will have to make sure your system
offers a SYSV compatible curses.  You can check that you do by looking
at its include file curses.h; it should e.g. contain KEY_ macros.  If you
have a system which contains BSD and SYSV curses libraries, make sure (by
checking the cmake variables) that the SYSV curses.h is used.  This
particularly applies if you use the SYSV curses clone ncurses.  If you do
so, further make sure that you use version 4 or higher.  Otherwise teapot
may not work correctly and you get corrupted screen output.  Since version
4 makes it easy to be built as shared (ELF) library, this can reduce the
size of the teapot binary considerably.

If you want the curses frontend to be fully UTF-8 aware, you need
libncursesw (Debian package name: libncursesw5-dev).
