At first, check if your system is listed in the Makefile variable
settings.  If so, uncomment it, everything should work and you can skip
the next paragraph.

Before you can install teapot, you will have to make sure your system
offers a SYSV compatible curses.  You can check that you do by looking
at its include file curses.h; it should e.g. contain KEY_ macros.  If you
have a system which contains BSD and SYSV curses libraries, make sure (by
-I CPPFLAGS) that the SYSV curses.h is used.  This particularly applies
if you use the SYSV curses clone ncurses.  If you do so, further make
sure that you use version 4 or higher.  Otherwise teapot may not work
correctly and you get corrupted screen output.  Since version 4 makes
it easy to be built as shared (ELF) library, this can reduce the size
of the teapot binary considerably.

To use a different language than English, change the symlink cat.h to
point to the cat-*.h file you want to use and recompile teapot.  That way,
you get a different default language.  I can't give you hints on how
to use message catalogs, as this differs a lot from system to system.
In particular, the Linux libc 5.x breaks message catalogs by always
expanding %L to C in NLSPATH.  Either you don't use NLSPATH and put the
message catalog in a default location searched by the library or you
don't use %L.
